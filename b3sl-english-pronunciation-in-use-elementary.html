I'm 26. I graduated high school in 2010 and I've struggled with math my entire life. I mean that as literal as possible, I was put into remedial math classes around 4th grade and that continued until I graduated high school. Teachers in elementary tried to teach me math but my brain and body would literally shut down and I would cry and refuse to do anything. From then on, my remedial teachers taught me little math and passed me though their classes. I was a D student, and my grades were curved.

Evangelion in the original Japanese is full of wordplay and language-based nuances that may not have been fully captured by translations. I thought I'd collect everything I remember in one thread.

Admission Committee (it consists of two people who work independently) very meticulously assesses the documents of the applicant. First, it is necessary to have only excellent marks in all subjects for all quarters of the last two years of training.

Norfolk County is the birthplace of four U.S. presidents: John and John Quincy Adams, John F. Kennedy, and George H.W. Bush. 2.
